            <p>I have something to say</p>
            <p>So shut the fuck up and listen.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>I spent thirteen years half-cut to my eyeballs.</p>
            <p>Drunk, to put it mildly.</p>
            <p>Then suddenly I saw it, a streetlight shining in my face.</p>
            <p>500 Gigawatts of the power of God.</p>
            <p>A vision of my bloated body found in some ditch.</p>
            <p>Scared me straight.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So I got a collar shirt, mortgage and a credit card.</p>
            <p>All the things that make a good man.</p>
            <p>I hoped I could raise my children to be better than their old man.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I wanted to believe I was never one setback away from my worst self.</p>
            <p>But the truth is.</p>
            <br><p>Discipline.</p>
            <br><p>Drive.</p>
            <br><p>Routine.</p>
            <br><p>The endless fucking desperation to get shit done.</p>
            <br><p>A loving wife? Great kids?</p>
            <br><p>Sobriety?</p>
            <br><p>I’m telling you.</p>
            <br><br><br><p><i>You.</i></p>
            <br><p>Accomplishments I’d been chasing all my life.</p>
            <p>Never felt as good as I expected when I crossed the finish line.</p>
            <p>…</p>
            <p>So now that we’re at the end. Takin’ inventory.</p>
            <p>Those nights spinning out of my head, sinking into the sofa.</p>
            <p>Broken glass in my palms. Bleeding dry the funniest thing ever.</p>
            <p>Old dogs laughing and snarling on a waterbed floor, mocking the moon for daring to show its face.</p>
            <p>All nausea and wreckage and vomit and ugly cruelty.</p>
            <p>The only problem in the world an empty bottle.</p>
            <p>Those were the best days of my life.</p>
            <br><br><p>Yeah.</p>
            <br><br><p>…Those were the best days of my life.</p>
            <br><p>I got nothing to hide. Ready to face the music.</p>
            <p>I can see myself for what I am.</p>
            <p>But you? A cowardly, selfish motherfucker and you can’t even see it.</p>
            <br><br><br><p>…I should’ve been able to protect the kid.</p>
            <p>If I could have done one thing right, I wish it had been to give him one small chance off this goddamned
                rock. </p>
